#  E-Commerce Backend API

This project is part of the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**, focused on building a scalable and maintainable backend for an e-commerce platform. It supports key features like user management, product listing, order processing, and payment integration.

---

##  Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is an intensive and practical curriculum designed to equip developers with industry-ready backend development skills. The program covers:

- Programming fundamentals with **Python**
- Building robust APIs using **Django** and **Django REST Framework**
- Implementing **GraphQL** for flexible data querying
- **Containerization** using Docker
- Automating deployment with **CI/CD** pipelines

This e-commerce backend serves as a capstone project, applying all the key concepts and tools introduced during the program.

## Key Technologies

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Django** – Web framework for rapid backend development
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – For creating RESTful APIs
- **GraphQL (Graphene-Django)** – For flexible API queries
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
- **Redis** – Caching and task queue backend
- **Celery** – Asynchronous task processing
- **Docker** – For containerized development and deployment
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI** – For continuous integration and delivery

##  Core Backend Concepts Learned

### 1. **Database Design & Modeling**

- Normalized schema for users, products, orders, and reviews
- Implemented relationships using foreign keys and many-to-many fields
- Applied indexing and constraints for performance and data integrity

### 2. **Asynchronous Programming**

- Integrated **Celery** with **Redis** for background tasks
- Used async tasks for order processing, sending emails, and notifications
- Configured task retries and failure handling

### 3. **API Design (REST & GraphQL)**

- Developed RESTful APIs with DRF using serializers, viewsets, and routers
- Implemented GraphQL using `graphene-django` with custom resolvers
- Included filtering, pagination, and versioning

### 4. **Caching Strategies**

- Cached frequent queries (e.g., product listings) using Redis
- Implemented cache invalidation on data updates
- Improved API response time significantly

##  Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Complex product filtering and sorting | Used Django ORM optimizations and custom filter backends |
| Long-running order processes | Offloaded to asynchronous Celery workers |
| GraphQL nested data complexity | Built custom resolvers for optimized data fetching |
| Deployment inconsistencies | Dockerized the app and created CI/CD workflows |

---

## Best Practices Followed

- Modular code using Django apps
- Environment-specific settings using `.env` files
- Test-driven development with `pytest` and API tests
- Followed PEP8 and clean code principles
- Used Git branches and pull requests for version control
- Secured APIs with Django’s built-in features and token authentication

---

## Personal Takeaways

- Gained hands-on experience in full-cycle backend development
- Understood the value of asynchronous programming for scaling applications
- Learned how to debug and optimize database queries
- Improved API design skills with both REST and GraphQL
- Built confidence in using DevOps tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines
